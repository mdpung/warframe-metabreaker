## What?
Warframe Metabreaker is an application to compare stats of other weapons in its class. This allows direct comparisons into where a weapon's stat is relative all the rest of the weapons of its type.
## Why?
Trying out new builds is part of the fun in Warframe (imo), so this is a tool to help give some clarity on which weapon to make a build for. I made this is as a tool to use myself, but still want to put it out there for others to benefit from as well.

## How to use `// TODO`
At its current state, it only scrapes the necessary data for each weapon so it's not very purposeful at the moment... 

More details will be included when it's in a more functional state. Consider it... early access...

## Notes
Since this is a web scraper, it makes HTTP requests, and if it is poorly optimized, it can make too many requests against warframe.fandom.com. To reduce the amount of requests to their servers, the app can download all the necessary HTML pages so we can tinker and do whatever we want with them.

## Tests
They're used as debugging at the moment, not really tests
